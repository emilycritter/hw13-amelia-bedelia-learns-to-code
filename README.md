# Rails: Moving into Advanced
## Watching and Writing: Amelia Bedelia
###### Due Tuesday, March 08, 2016
You're not alone. Many people make the same mistakes you do :)

"Did you really think you could make changes to the database by editing the schema file? Who are you, Amelia Bedelia?" The silly mistakes we all made when first learning Rails may be funny to us now, but we should remember how we felt at the time. New developers don't always realize senior developers were once beginners too and may assume they are the first and last developer to mix up when to use the rails and rake commands. This talk is a lighthearted examination of the kinds of common errors many Rails developers make and will dig into why so many of us make the same mistakes.

Please watch [Amelia Bedelia Learns to Code](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-amelia-bedelia-learns-to-code), and write a blog post with your reactions to it. Any mistakes you've made that seem commonplace? Any tips you'll remember for the future?

## Response
We started off the week reviewing the weekend's reddit lab. The workload ramped up dramatically last week, and many of us were left scrambling to complete assignments. As a result, Monday predominantly consisted of review and Monday's homework was to watch the "Amelia Bedelia Learns to Code" talk by Kylie Stradley from the 2015 RailsConf.  The takeaway from the video is that developers all make mistakes. I'll say that again. We all make mistakes.

This message comes at a great time. If I had a log of recent stories Iâ€™ve read, it would show that this is a common theme. One article that resonated with me was "[6 Reasons Why Perfectionism Kills Your Productivity
](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/6-reasons-why-perfectionism-kills-your-productivity.html)" by Ellen Eldridge. The point of the article is that sometimes it's more important to start a project, make progess, and cherish creativity than it is to fret and plan for a perfect outcome. I often find myself in some limbo state of anxiety-procrastination driven by unrealistic expectations and the desire to suceed on my first attempt. This routine sucks. In addition to causing unnecessary stress, it tends to be an expectation I put on myself that quite frankly no one else gives a damn about. While my transition from the science-world to the development-world has aligned fairly well with my assumptions, one of the aspects I did not foresee was the "mistakes happen" attitude.
